# Open-Research-course

**Welcome to the Open Research course!** This course will guide you in making your research more open.

This course is intended for self-paced learning, aimed at academic researchers and scientists in any field and at any stage of their careers. The course is organised into 8 chapters, which you can either complete step-by-step over 8 weeks, or you can focus on specific topics of interest!

**Outline**: First, you will explore what open research is, why itâ€™s important, and how it can be applied to different disciplines and stages of the research process. You will become familiar with the underlying principles of open research: transparency, integrity, and accessibility. You will consider the actions you need to take to ensure your own research outputs meet all three of these standards.
